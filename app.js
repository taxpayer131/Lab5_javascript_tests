/* Problem 1 (this is your demo that we'll solve in class)
Write a function called sum() that takes in two numbers as arguments and then returns an array where
the first element is the sum of those numbers, and the second element is a concatenated string that
EXACTLY follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function:
"The sum of 4 and 7 is 11."
Test this function by hand in the console to get it working, and when you think it is finished, uncomment
the call for the testSum() function below and check the console to see if the test passes.*/

function testSum(a,b){ //eslint-disable-line
  var mySum = a + b;
  var myMsg = 'The sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' is ' + mySum + '.';
  return [mySum, myMsg];
}

// Here is the test for sum(); uncomment it to run it
testSum(4, 7);

/* Once you get the test passing, do an a-c-p cycle and synchronize the code between GitHub and
your laptop. Don't forget to create a new branch for your work on the next question!*/
